DDAuto is a simple REST-service for dynamic DNS. It uses the [Java Domainrobot Sdk](https://github.com/InterNetX/java-domainrobot-sdk) to update the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of a host and can be used with many routers, for example the AVM Fritz!Box.
DDAuto can be executed by `commandline`, `init.d` or `systemd`.

Requirement: An AutoDNS account! For further details have a look at [AutoDNS: Efficient Domain-Management for Resellers](https://www.internetx.com/en/domains/autodns)

If you find a bug or certain features are missing, don't hesitate to file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DDAuto/issues).

For completeness, here is the [changelog](changelog.md).

DDAuto is kindly supported by <br> <a href="https://jb.gg/OpenSourceSupport"><img src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/IntelliJ_IDEA.png" width="250px" alt="IntelliJ IDEA logo."></a>

## Big picture

DDAuto is running as a service. A client can access the service via url and basic-auth. Let's assume DDAuto is running on `localhost`, then we can update the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the host _mydyndns.domain.com_ by calling the following curl command:
```bash
curl -u dyndns:test123 -i \ 
   "http://localhost:8081/update/mydyndns.domain.com/?apitoken=1234567890abcdf&ipv4=127.1.2.4&ipv6=2a03:4000:41:32::2"
```
For each host an api-token must be defined. If the api-token doesn't match the host, the update will be rejected. Due to this security feature, DDAuto can be used by different people. They can't update the IPs each other.


## Configuration and start

DDAuto is a spring boot application, that's why the application is extremely customizable just by configuration! Details of the configuration can be found here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#application-properties and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator.monitoring.customizing-management-server-port

Side note: To avoid the use of the java keystore tool, DDAuto could be run behind a proxy. Corresponding headers are set by default.

Here is the suggested directory/file structure:

```bash
├── /opt/ddauto
│   ├── ddauto.yml
│   ├── ddauto-1.1.0.jar
│   ├── ddauto.jar -> ddauto-1.1.0.jar
│   ├── ddauto-zone.log   (log of the zone updates)
│   ├── logback.xml       (logback configuration for application and zone update logoging, optional)
│   ├── logback_zone.xml  (extra logback configuration for zone update logging, optional include) 
```
Side note: If the names of the configuration files are kept as above, they will be found and loaded automatically.

ddauto.yml defines the individual properties and will be merged with the default one in the classpath, therefore the file can be kept as small as possible. A minimal configuration example can be found further below. If the file is inside the working directory, it is loaded automatically. The default properties can be found [here](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DDAuto/wiki/Complete-Configuration-Example). <br>
Important: The basic-auth, the api-tokens and the credentials for AutoDNS should be defined in this file!<br>
The configuration of Logback is split into two files, one for the application logging and one for a the well-formatted zone update log. Further information can be found in the wiki [Logback Configuration](https://github.com/th-schwarz/DDAuto/wiki/Logback-Configuration).

The start by command line looks like:
```bash
java -jar /opt/ddauto/ddauto.jar
```
DDAuto can also be started easily as a service. For further information, see https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment.installing.nix-services


## Configuration

### Zones and Hosts

Minimal example: 
```yaml
zones:
  -  
    name: dynhost.info   # the zone
    ns: ns.domain.info   # the primary nameserver of the zone
    hosts:
      - myhost:1234567890abcdef
```
The last line defines the host ```myhost.dynhost.info``` with the api-token `1234567890abcdef`.


### AutoDNS (DomainRobot)

Minimal example: 
```yaml
autodns:
  user: ddauto
  password: test123
```

## Routes

All routes that belong to zones and hosts are secured by basic-auth. A detailed description of the routes can be found at the [OAS3 documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/th-schwarz/DDAuto/blob/develop/docs/index.html).

There are two additional routes which deliver web pages:
* [/]: A simple greeting page which is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting the property ```ddauto.greeting-enabled=false```.
* [/log]: Delivers a simple web page to view the zone update logs and is secured by basic-auth and can be configured by setting the two properties ```ddauto.zone-log-user-name``` and ```ddauto.zone-log-user-password```. It is enabled by default but it can be disabled by setting the property ```ddauto.zone-log-page-enabled=false```.


## Suggested AutoDNS setup

For security reasons, it makes sense to create a separate owner for the zone updated by DDAuto. This owner just needs the permission for zone-info and zone-updates!


## Setup a router for dynamic DNS

As an example, let's have a look at the setup of dynamic DNS in the [Fritz!Box 7590](https://service.avm.de/help/en/FRITZ-Box-7530/019p2/hilfe_dyndns). 
The following settngs are required:
* *DynDNS Provider:* User-defined
* *Domain name:* The hostname for which the IPs should be updated.
* *Username / Password:* The credentials for basic-auth.
* *Update-URL:* {baseUrl}/update/\<domain\>/?apitoken=[yourApitoken]&ipv4=\<ipaddr\>&ipv6=\<ip6addr\> <br>
  If both IP parameters are omitted, an attempt is made to fetch the remote IP.
